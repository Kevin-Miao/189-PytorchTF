# 189-PytorchTF

Welcome to the assignment for `Pytorch/TensorFlow Tutorial` in EE16ML.
This repository and the contained files have been created by team **DSS**, consisting of Amanda Ma, Kevin Miao, Sandeep Sainath and Youngli Hong.

## Pre-Requisites

Before you start this assignment, we assume the following pre-requisite knowledge:

- CS61A and CS61B or any similar programming experience
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Data Structures and Runtime Complexity
  - Proficiency in Python

- EE16A/B or any similar linear algebra or introductory machine learning knowledge

- For this assignment, we assume that you are up-to-speed with all the material including week 8.
Specifically, we assume that you have completed the following modules and their respective theoretical knowledge in week 8:
- CNNs
- Using Pre-Trained Models
- Importing Datasets and Augmentation *(Optional)*

## Environment Set Up

For this module, we will be both working with **DataHub/Jupyter Notebook**. Please refer to [this link](https://jupyter.org/install) to get more information on how to run **Jupyter** locally.
**Additionally**, we will also be using **Google Colab** to use GPUs to train our models. If you are using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), make sure to log in on with your bMail and follow the prompts until you see an orange window containing a 'Welcome to Colab' notebook. The use should be pretty intuitive and similar to JupyterNotebook.

### Running GPU (Google Colab)

- Open `notebook`
- Click on `Runtime` in the menu bar
- `Change Runtime` to `GPU`
- `Save`

## Learning Objectives

After this module you should:

- be able to feel the differences between the two libraries.
- be able to load and augment data.[^1]
- be able to start from scratch to train a neural network and train a pre-trained model using any of the two libraries.
- be able to effectively debug and read through documentation.

As part of our curriculum, we will also be including ethics questions throughout the assignments.

[^1] : Since there is no other group covering the data loading and data augmentation, we will be covering it shortly.

## Module Structure

The module will consists of:
- slide deck
- lecture notes
- assignments
  - Introduction to PyTorch and TF
  - PyTorch Assignment
  - TensorFlow Assignment
  - Capstone Project
