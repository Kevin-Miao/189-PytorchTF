    "# Final Project: Bone Fracture Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For this final project, you will be implementing a binary classification model that classifies, given an image of a humerus bone, whether it is fractured or normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessed data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wnsvPpJ01ZnFk6IEf5m1m1vv7ICbXzQa/view?usp=sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose to use either Tensorflow/Keras or Pytorch to train your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensorflow/Keras** *Strict Requirements: <br>*\n",
    "A. Model layers must be customized. Pre-trained models are **not** allowed! <br>\n",
    "B. Use the *.history* attribute to create two color-coded visualizations: 1) training and validation accuracies per epoch, 2) training and validation losses per epoch  \n",
    "C. (optional) Use Keras callbacks for early stopping. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pytorch** *Strict Requirements: <br>*\n",
    "A. Model must be constructed from scratch using PyTorch. Pre-trained models are **not** allowed.\n",
    "B. Must implement two **data augmentations**, write **custom datasets**.\n",
    "C. You can load any models that you want.\n",
    "D. Perform Hyperparameter Tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some tips before you get started**:\n",
    "    - Loading the dataset: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35067957/how-to-read-pickle-file\n",
    "    - Refer to Assignment 2 to help you out with writing this project from scratch.\n",
    "    - Don't worry if your accuracy is low; it's alright. The exercise is to have you implement something from scratch."
