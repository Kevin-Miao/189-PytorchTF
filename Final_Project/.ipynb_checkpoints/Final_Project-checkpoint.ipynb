    "A. Model must be constructed from scratch using Tensorflow. Pre-trained models are not allowed. <br>\n",
    "B. Must use tensorflow callbacks to save the model, and to provide two color-coded visualizations: 1) training and validation accuracies per epoch, 2) training and validation losses per epoch <br> (read about tensorflow callbacks prior to training your model) \n",
